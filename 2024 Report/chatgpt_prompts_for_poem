Please write a poem about my fantasy football season. Among other things, there should be:‭ 
- 3 stanzas on GOBias Industries, the champion
- 2 stanzas on Schmaap, the finalist
- 1 stanza on each of the remaining teams

2024 DKEHeads Report‬
‭ GOBias Industries: the 3-time Champion‬
‬‭ GOBias Industries cemented its reputation as one of the elite franchises in DKEHeads‬
‭ history,‬‭ securing its 3rd title in 13 seasons‬‭ .‬
‬‭ Schulwolf became the first owner to win 3 titles.‬
‬‭ GOBias Industries was a juggernaut the entire year, averaging‬‭ 123.6 points per game‬
‭ in the regular season (‬‭
+10.8 PPG above league average, 2nd of 12 teams‬‭ ) and 148.2‬
‭ PPG in the playoffs.‬
‭‬‭ While arguably lacking big-name stars (no players like Saquon Barkley, Ja’Marr Chase‬
‭ or Lamar Jackson), GOBias Industries was blessed with a balanced roster that was‬
‭ strong across almost every position:‬
‬‭ QB‬‭ :‬‭ 18.1 PPG (5th of 12 teams, +0.2 PPG above league average).‬‭ This‬
‭ outcome was great for GOBias Industries, as they spent only $3 to acquire‬
‭ Jayden Daniels. Daniels also exploded for back-to-back +30 point performances‬
‭ in the playoffs.‬
‭‬‭ RB (top 2): 32.4 PPG (2nd of 12 teams, +4.3 PPG above league average)‬
‭ Schulwolf got excellent production from Jahmyr Gibbs (18.3 PPG) and James‬
‭ Cook (16.1 PPG).‬
WR: 41.0 PPG (3rd of 12 teams, 5.3 PPG above league average):‬‭ GOBias‬
‭ Industries rotated its WRs very effectively in response to injuries / trends. The‬
‭ most consistent producers were Terry McLaurin (12.8 PPG) and DeVonta Smith‬
‭ (12.7 PPG), but GOBias Industries was also got good production from Chris‬
‭ Godwin (16.1 PPG in weeks 1-7), Cooper Kupp (11.8 PPG), and Adam Thielen‬
‭ (15.5 PPG in weeks 14-17).‬
‬‭ TE: 6.6 PPG (12th of 12 teams,
-2.1 PPG below league average):‬‭ This was the‬
‭ only weak position, as Dalton Kincaid was disappointing.‬
‬‭ DEF: 9.8 PPG (2nd of 12 teams, +2.2 PPG above league average):‬‭ GOBias‬
‭ Industries scored tons of points using the Denver D/ST (12.8 PPG in eight‬
‭ regular season starts)..‬
‬‭ K: 10.6 PPG (2nd of 12 teams, +1.6 PPG above league average):‬‭ GOBias‬
‭ Industries’ secret weapon was Dallas kicker Brandon Aubrey. Who knows, he‬
‭ might even be able to kick a +70 yard field goal next year.‬
‭
‬‭ GOBias Industries started the season with a bang, winning their first 4 games and‬
‭ averaging 129.1 PPG in that span.‬
‬‭ After a disappointing loss to “Brady come back u can blame it” in Week 5, GOBias‬
‭ Industries went on another 4-game winning streak to start the season 8-1.‬
‬‭ During the 8-1 start, GOBias Industries scored over +120 points 7 times and averaged‬
‭ 122.7 PPG.‬
‬‭ GOBias Industries struggled at times down the stretch (going 3-2 with 115.7 PPG from‬
‭ weeks 10-14, scoring +120 points just once in that span), but a 172.94 point bonanza in‬
‭ Week 15 showed that GOBias Industries meant business in the playoffs.‬
‬‭ GOBias Industries was the sixth team in DKEHeads history to win 11+ games (curiously,‬
‭ no team has ever won exactly 11 games).‬
‬‭ Like all great champions, GOBias Industries elevated their game in the playoffs, crushing‬
‭ Mr. Fans Noodle Haus 149.72 - 104.68 in the semifinals before defeating Schmaap‬
‭ 146.68 - 121.06 in the final.‬
‬‭ Schulwolf is now 6-1 in playoff games and 3-0 in finals in four postseason appearances.‬
‭ Schmaap: the Worthy Finalist‬
‬‭ Schmaap, everyone’s favorite portmanteau, had a tremendous season, going 10-5‬
‭ before falling to GOBias Industries in the final.‬
‬‭ Schmaap scored 121.5 points per game (4th of 12 teams),
+8.8 PPG above league‬
‭ average.‬
‬‭ Similar to GOBias Industries, Schmaap had a very balanced roster, with no real‬
‭ weaknesses.‬
‬‭ QB: 17.5 PPG (6th of 12 teams,
-0.4 PPG vs. league average)‬‭ : Schmaap had‬
‭ solid production from Brock Purdy and Bo Nix. These bargain buys allowed‬
‭ Schmaap to invest in other parts of the roster.‬
‬‭ RB (top 2): 31.9 PPG from top 2 RB (3rd of 12 teams, +3.8 PPG vs. league‬
‭ average)‬‭ : Schmaap relied on Josh Jacobs (16.5 PPG) and David Montgomery‬
‭ (14.6 PPG) to carry the load. Schmaap also got decent production from Rico‬
‭ Dowdle (11.2 PPG in games started). Schmaap suffered from a pathetic 3.0 PPG‬
‭ from Gus Edwards in weeks 1-4.‬
‬‭ WR: 37.0 PPG from top 3 WR (5th of 12 teams, +1.3 PPG vs. league‬
‭ average)‬‭ : WR was a major weakness for Schmaap in the first half of the year‬
‭ (just 27.1 PPG in weeks 1-7), but Puka Nacua’s return from injury gave Schmaap‬
‭ a huge boost (45.7 PPG in weeks 8-15). Schmaap’s main studs were Nacua‬
‭ (16.3 PPG from weeks 9-17) and CeeDee Lamb (14.2 PPG), while Jaylen‬
‭ Waddle was disappointing (8.7 PPG).‬
‬‭ TE: 11.3 PPG (3rd of 12 teams, +2.6 PPG vs. league average)‬‭ : Brock Bowers‬
‭ was a revelation for Schmaap.‬
‬‭ Schmaap got off to a slow start, going 1-3 in their first 4 games, averaging only 99.0‬
‭ PPG in that span (11th of 12 teams).‬
‬‭ With their backs to the wall, Schmaap reeled off 4 straight wins (127 PPG) to enter the‬
‭ league’s top half at 5-3.‬
‬‭ With Puka back from injury, Schmaap surged in Weeks 11-14, averaging an astonishing‬
‭ 147.4 PPG in that stretch to improve to 10-4. This stretch (147.4 PPG) was the‬
‭ second-best 4-game run in the PPR era (see below).‬
‭
‭ Unfortunately for Schmaap, the momentum wouldn’t last. A devastating Week 15 Injury‬
‭ to David Montgomery severely hurt their title hopes (especially because this boosted the‬
‭ value of GOBias Industries’ Jahymr Gibbs). Disaster struck again when CeeDee Lamb‬
‭ was shut down for the season after Week 16.‬
‬‭ Despite these setbacks, Schmaap remained competitive, edging Pierogi Night 119.72 -
‭ 103.1 in the semifinals before falling to GOBias Industries (121.06 - 146.68).‬
‬‭ Schmaap went 0-3 vs. GOBias Industries but 11-3 against the rest of the league.‬
‬‭ Schmaap made the playoffs despite a brutal schedule, as they had to face GOBias‬
‭ Industries, Sackwash Lyfe, and Pay Dirt & Pylons IV twice in the regular season.‬
‭
‬‭ Burnett is now 3-1 in semifinals, but 0-3 in finals in DKEHeads.‬
‭
 Mr. Fans Noodle Haus: Strong Start, Late Season Fade‬
‬‭ Mr. Fans Noodle Haus had a successful season, qualifying for the playoffs for the first‬
‭ time since 2020.‬
‬‭ Mr. Fan scored 113.78 PPG in the regular season‬‭ (6th of 12 teams, +1.06 PPG above‬
‭ league average‬‭ ).‬
‬‭ Mr. Fan looked like a juggernaut early in the season, starting the year 6-1 (averaging‬
‭ 121.7 PPG in that span,
+10.9 PPG above league average).‬
‬‭ However, Mr. Fan struggled down the stretch, going 3-5 in the last 8 games (averaging‬
‭ 106.8 PPG,
-7.6 PPG below league average).‬
‬‭ This -14.9 PPG drop between Weeks 1-7 and Weeks 8-15 was the worst in the league‬
‭ (see below).‬
‭
‭
‭
‭
‭
‭ Despite these difficulties, Mr. Fan eked into the playoffs with a key Week 15 win (124.80‬
- 79.44 over Gee Whiz Darnell).‬
‬‭ After a lackluster semifinal loss to GOBias Industries (104.68 -149.72), Mr. Fan erupted‬
‭ with their best performance of the year in the 3rd place game, defeating Pierogi Night‬
‭ 146.12 - 124.96.‬
‬‭ Mr. Fan had an imbalanced roster: very strong at QB, deep at RB, but very weak at WR:‬
‬‭ QB: 24.3 PPG (1st of 12 teams, +6.4 PPG vs. league average)‬‭ : Lamar‬
‭ Jackson was sensational.‬
‬‭ RB (top 2): 29.0 PPG (6th of 12 teams, +0.9 PPG vs. league average)‬‭ . Mr. Fan‬
‭ was deep at the position, having 3 quality running backs: Alvin Kamara (16.5‬
‭ PPG), Jonathan Taylor (13.2 PPG in regular season, 16.2 PPG overall), and‬
‭ Brian Robinson (10.7 PPG). Mr. Fan had the 4th-most total points at the RB‬
‭ position (counting RBs 1-3).‬
‬‭ WR‬‭ (top 3): 27.8 PPG (12th of 12 teams,
-7.9 PPG vs.‬‭ league average)‬‭ . WR‬
‭ was a disaster for Mr. Fan. Tee Higgins (16.7 PPG) and Stefon Diggs (12.3 PPG)‬
‭ were great in limited action, but missed much of the season to injury. Amari‬
 Cooper (7.2 PPG) was a bust. Christian Kirk also sucked. Jauan Jennings was‬
‭ ok (9.88 PPG in games started). Mr. Fan was forced to start players like Kayshon‬
‭ Boutte, Elijah Moore, Parker Washington, and DeMarcus Robinson, which is‬
‭ never a good sign.‬
‬‭ K: 10.7 PPG (1st of 12 teams, +1.8 PPG vs. league average):‬‭ Ka’imi Fairbairn‬
‭ of Houston was excellent, scoring double digits in 10 of his first 13 games.‬
‭ Pierogi Night: the Most Improbable of Comebacks‬
‬‭ Pierogi Night made the playoffs despite starting the year 1-6, winning 8 straight games to‬
‭ finish at 9-6.‬
‬‭ Pierogi Night was the second team in league history to make the playoffs after starting‬
‭ 1-6. (Gee Whiz Darnell in 2023 was the only other team to accomplish the feat).‬
‬‭ Pierogi Night scored 114.87 PPG in the regular season‬‭ (5th of 12 teams, +2.15 PPG‬
‭ above league average‬‭ ).‬
‬‭ Pierogi Night was average at most positions, but was strong at RB because of Derrick‬
‭ Henry.‬
‬‭ QB: 17.0 PPG (7th of 12 teams,
-0.9 PPG vs. league average)‬‭ : Patrick‬
‭ Mahomes was disappointing this year, putting Pierogi Night in a big hole. Starting‬
‭ Matthew Stafford in the playoffs (7.6 PPG in Weeks 16-17), however, was still a‬
‭ mistake.‬
‬‭ RB: 31.8 PPG (4th of 12 teams, +3.6 PPG vs. league average)‬‭ : Derrick Henry‬
‭ was a monster, averaging 18.6 PPG. Pierogi Night also got strong contributions‬
‭ from Kareem Hunt (13.0 PPG) and Chase Brown (16.7 PPG in games started).‬
‭ These unexpected surprises made up for the lack of production from Nick Chubb‬
‭ (8.8 PPG in games started).‬
‬‭ WR: 35.7 PPG (6th of 12 teams,
-0.0 PPG vs. league average)‬‭ : Pierogi Night’s‬
‭ top WR star was Mike Evans (14.6 PPG), while Davante Adams (13.8 PPG)‬
‭ started slow but finished strong. Khalil Shakir provided good secondary‬
‭ production (10.1 PPG), but Tank Dell was a letdown (7.6 PPG).‬
‬‭ Pierogi Night’s 8-game win streak to end the season was tied for the longest streak in‬
‭ the PPR era (2021-2024; see below), tying Pierogi Night from 2022.‬
‬‭ The longest win streak in league history belongs to Schmop (11 wins, 2016).‬
‭
‭
‭
‭
‭‭
 Sackwash Lyfe: Points but no Playoffs‬

‬‭ Sackwash Lyfe was arguably the strongest team (statistically) in DKEHeads this year,‬
‭ leading the league in points in the regular season (‬‭ 124.9 PPG, 1st of 12 teams, +12.1‬
‭ PPG above league baseline‬‭ ).‬
 Sackwash Lyfe was unlucky to go just 8-7; their expected record was 10-5 based on‬
‭ their point totals.‬
Sackwash Lyfe was the 2nd best non-playoff team in league history, and the 10th best‬
‭ overall team. (Tommy has 4 of the 10 best teams in league history by regular season‬
‭ points, but 0 titles).‬
Sackwash Lyfe was the 2nd-best team in the PPR era (2021-2024), trailing only Pay Dirt‬
‭ & Pylons (2021).‬
‭‭ Sackwash Lyfe was carried by this year’s fantasy MVP Saquon Barkley, and real-life‬
‭ MVP candidate Josh Allen.‬
QB‬‭ :‬‭ 23.7 PPG (2nd of 12 teams, +5.8 PPG above league‬‭ average)‬‭. Josh Allen‬
‭ had another great season, punctuated by back-to-back +40 point efforts in‬
‭ Weeks 14-15.‬
‭ RB (top 2): 37.0 PPG (1st of 12 teams, +8.9 PPG above league average):‬
‭ Saquon Barkley (21.0 PPG) broke fantasy as the #1 overall RB. Kyren Williams‬
‭ was also excellent (15.8 PPG), while Rachaad White (11.0 PPG) was a solid‬
‭ tertiary option.‬
WR (top 3)‬‭ :‬‭ 31.9 PPG (10th of 12 teams,
-3.9 PPG below‬‭ league average)‬‭ :‬
‭ this was easily Sackwash Lyfe’s weakest position. Malik Nabers was solid (13.4‬
‭ PPG) but DK Metcalf (10.5 PPG) faded down the stretch. Xavier Worthy was‬
‭ inconsistent (7.8 PPG).‬
Sackwash Lyfe began the season strong, starting 6-2 with 126.1 PPG.‬
‬‭ However, a four game losing streak dropped New Drywall to 6-6, sparking Tommy to‬
‭ change the team name back to Sackwash Lyfe. The squad averaged a (relatively)‬
‭ pedestrian 109.3 PPG in that span - but still very unlucky to go 0-4.‬
‬‭ Sackwash Lyfe exploded for 142.4 PPG in the final 3 weeks, but a devastating 171.5 -
‭ 162.78 loss to Schmaap in Week 14 effectively ended the season.‬

‭ Pay Dirt & Pylons IV: Points but No Playoffs, Part II‬
‬‭ Pay Dirt & Pylons had a prolific season statistically (‬‭ 123.3 PPG, +10.6 PPG above‬
‭ league average, 3rd of 12 teams in total points‬‭ ) but‬‭ failed to make the playoffs.‬
‬‭ Similar to Sackwash Lyfe, Pay Dirt finished 8-7, but should have had a record closer to‬
‭ 10-5.‬
‬‭ Pay Dirt started the season strong, going 5-1 in their first 6 games (131.0 PPG). This‬
‭ stretch was highlighted by a 176.78 point explosion in Week 5, the highest single-game‬
‭ score by any team this year.‬
‬‭ Pay Dirt continued to put up points after Week 6, (118.1 PPG in the last nine games), but‬
‭ suffered from inconsistency and bad luck, going 3-6 the rest of the way to finish 8-7.‬
‬‭ Pay Dirt & Pylons had an extremely strong roster:‬
‬‭ QB: 21.1 PPG (3rd of 12 teams, +3.2 PPG above league average):‬‭ Joe Burrow‬
‭ ($6) proved to be a good investment.‬
‬‭ RB (top 2): 28.2 PPG (7th of 12 teams, +0.1 PPG above league average)‬‭ : Pay‬
‭ Dirt had some solid (if unspectacular) RBs, including Aaron Jones (13.3 PPG),‬
‭ D’Andre Swift (12.3 PPG) and JK Dobbins (13.7 PPG). Rhamondre Stevenson‬
‭ (8.9 PPG) was a depth piece.‬
‬‭ WR (top 3): 41.8 PPG (2nd of 12 teams, +6.1 PPG above league average):‬
‭ Ja’Marr Chase was the #1 WR (20.3 PPG), Nico Collins dominated (14.7 PPG),‬
‭ while Jakobi Meyers (11.1 PPG in games started) flew under the radar. These‬
‭ successes made up for Brandon Aiyuk’s lost season (7.1 PPG from weeks 1-7).‬
‬‭ TE: 11.8 PPG (2nd of 12 teams, +3.1 PPG):‬‭ Pay Dirt‬‭ benefitted from a strong‬
‭ season by George Kittle.‬
‭‬‭ Pay Dirt & Pylons will regret losing twice to Herbin Legends (lowest scoring team in the‬
‭ league).‬
‬‭ Pay Dirt & Pylons IV was the 4th best non-playoff team in history (see above), and was‬
‭ the 4th best team in the PPR era (2021-2024; see below).‬
‭ Grip Hamilton Memorial 5K: Lucky to be in Playoff Contention‬
‬‭ Grip Hamilton Memorial 5K spent most of the season in the playoff mix and finished 9-6,‬
‭ despite below-average scoring (‬‭ 107.4 PPG,
-5.3 PPG below league average, 8th of 12‬
‭ teams in points).‬
‬‭ Grip Hamilton went 9-6, but had the statistical profile of a 6-9 team.‬
‬‭ Grip Hamilton struggled at most positions but had decent RBs:‬
‬‭ QB: 14.4 PPG (10th of 12 teams,
-3.6 PPG below league average):‬‭ CJ Stroud‬
‭ disappointed; a late-season pivot to Justin Herbert was also unsuccessful.‬
‬‭ RB (top 2): 29.9 PPG (4th of 12 teams, +1.8 PPG above league average)‬‭ : Grip‬
‭ Hamilton had multiple strong pieces, including Joe Mixon (16.4 PPG), Chuba‬
‭ Hubbard (13.9 PPG), and Najee Harris (10.6 PPG). Grip Hamilton was able to‬
‭ overcome a Week 2 injury to Isiah Pacheco.‬
‬‭ WR (top 3): 32.33 PPG (9th of 12 teams,
-3.4 PPG below league average):‬
‭ Grip Hamilton had a few decent WRs, but no standouts. The top producers were‬
‭ George Pickens (10.7 PPG), Jordan Addison (12.3 PPG), and DeAndre Hopkins‬
‭ (10.5 PPG). Chris Olave (6.6 PPG, injury) was a major bust, while Marvin‬
‭ Harrison Jr. (9.4 PPG) did not live up to the hype.‬
‬‭ DEF: 10.0 PPG (1st of 12 teams, +2.4 PPG above league average)‬‭ : Grip‬
‭ Hamilton led the league in D/ST points, relying on 11 (!) different teams in 15‬
‭ weeks to find the best matchups.‬
‬‭ Grip Hamilton went 8-3 in their first 11 games, and appeared poised to make the playoffs‬
‭ at 9-5 entering Week 15.‬
‬‭ However, Grip Hamilton couldn’t get past Herbin Legends in the season finale, losing 68‬
- 96.88 in their worst performance of the year.‬
‭
‭8Chane: Strong Start, Strong Finish…but Midseason Mediocrity‬
8Chane had an inconsistent season, finishing 6-9 and scoring just below league average‬
‭ (‬‭ 110.33 PPG, 7th of 12 teams,
-2.4 PPG below average‬‭ ).‬
‭ 8Chane started strongly, winning their first 2 games and ranking 2nd of 12 teams in‬
‭ scoring (131.4 PPG).‬
‬‭ However, the wheels soon fell off, as 8Chane went 2-9 with 103.6 PPG in the next 11‬
‭ games (11th of 12 teams in scoring in that stretch).‬
‭ Suddenly, 8Chane found itself in Sacko contention. But 8Chane won a 133.78 - 132.52‬
‭ thriller against “Bijan the second date” in Week 14 to salvage their season, and then‬
‭ played spoiler in Week 15 by defeating Pay Dirt & Pylons IV.‬
The strength of 8Chane’s roster was in their WRs; the rest of the team was average to‬
‭ below-average:‬
QB: 16.0 PPG (9th of 12 teams,
-1.9 PPG below league average):‬‭ 8Chane‬
‭ started the year with Dak Prescott (14.8 PPG), but switched to Sam Darnold‬
‭ (17.0 PPG) in midseason.‬
‬‭ RB (top 2): 27.8 PPG (9th of 12 teams,
-0.3 PPG below league average):‬
‭ De’Von Achane was a monster when Tua was healthy (15.0 PPG overall, 18.7‬
‭ PPG with Tua), while James Conner (14.6 PPG) was a consistent performer.‬
‭ 8Chane had little RB depth beyond those two players. 8Chane held onto‬
‭ Jonathan Brooks the entire season, to no avail.‬
WR (top 3): 39.7 PPG (4th of 12 teams, +4.0 PPG above league average):‬
‭ 8Chane was very deep at WR. AJ Brown may not have lived up to his price tag,‬
‭ but was solid (13.9 PPG), while Brian Thomas (13.2 PPG) was a revelation.‬
‭ Darnell Mooney (11.4 PPG) and Calvin Ridley (9.9 PPG in games started) were‬
‭ solid options, while Deebo Samuel was a bust (7.8 PPG). 8Chane got 0.0 points‬
‭ from Diontae Johson in both weeks 9 and 12.‬
‬‭ DEF/ST: 5.5 PPG (11th of 12 teams,
-2.1 PPG below league average):‬‭ 8Chane‬
‭ struggled to pick good options at D/ST. Lowlights included -6 from LV in Week 3‬
‭ (vs. CAR) and -5 from Chicago in Week 14 (vs. SF).‬
‬‭ 8Chane appeared in several nail-biters this year, taking part in the 4 tightest games in‬
‭ the league this season (and 5 of the top 6).‬
‭
‭ Bijan the Second Date: Studs and Duds‬
Bijan the Second Date had a (relatively) unremarkable season. They briefly sniffed the‬
‭ playoffs at midseason (5-5 after 10 games), but were never serious contenders. At the‬
‭ same time, they never came close to the Sacko.‬
‬‭ Bijan the Second Date had a top-heavy roster, with several big-name stars (Jalen Hurts,‬
‭ Bijan Robinson, Justin Jefferson) but zero depth:‬
‬‭ QB: 21.3 PPG (3rd of 12 teams, +3.3 PPG above league average)‬‭ : Jalen Hurts‬
‭ had another strong year.‬
‬‭ RB (top 2): 23.2 PPG (10th of 12 teams,
-4.9 PPG below league average):‬
‭ Bijan Robinson (16.7 PPG) justified his big price tag, but Eli’s team had no other‬
‭ good RBs. Jordan Mason was fine early in the season (10.9 PPG) but the other‬
‭ RBs averaged only 4.3 PPG (Tyjae Spears, Gus Edwards, etc.). Yuck.
‬‭ WR (top 3): 33.9 PPG (8th of 12 teams,
-1.8 PPG below league average)‬‭ :‬
‭ Justin Jefferson (15.3 PPG) was an alpha, as expected, and DJ Moore was a‬
‭ solid secondary option (10.8 PPG). But Rome Odunze (7.4 PPG) disappointed‬
‭ and the other options were terrible.‬
‬‭ DEF: 4.73 PPG (12th of 12 teams,
-2.8 PPG below league average)‬‭ . Bijan the‬
‭ Second Date was extremely loyal to the New York Jets defense, starting NYJ‬
‭ every week this season (even on the bye).‬
‬‭ Strangely, Bijan the Second Date had its best scoring output of the season in a loss‬
‭ (132.52 in Week 14 vs. 8Chane).‬



‭ Herbin Legends: The Team that Deserved the Sacko‬
‬‭ Herbin Legends scored the fewest points in the league this year,‬‭ recording just 98.6‬
‭ PPG (12th of 12 teams,
-14.2 PPG below league average‬‭ ).‬
‬‭ Herbin Legends had holes throughout the roster (RB the lone decent spot):‬
‬‭ QB: 11.2 PPG (12th of 12 teams,
-6.8 PPG below average):‬‭ Herbin Legends‬
‭ suffered from pathetic production at the QB position. The platoon of Anthony‬
‭ Richardson (11.1 PPG in starts) and Kirk Cousins (9.1 PPG in starts) was a‬
‭ disaster.‬
‬‭ RB (top 2): 29.9 PPG (8th of 12 teams,
-0.1 PPG below average)‬‭ : While‬
‭ Breece Hall (13.7 PPG) fell short of his price tag, Herbin Legends got solid‬
‭ production from Kenneth Walker (14.8 PPG) and Bucky Irving (12.3 PPG).‬
‬‭ WR (top 3): 30.9 PPG (11th of 12 teams,
-4.8 PPG below average)‬‭ : Garrett‬
‭ Wilson was serviceable (12.3 PPG) but Michael Pittman (7.4) and Keenan Allen‬
‭ (8.1) were disappointing. Jameson Williams (10.9 PPG) was a pleasant surprise,‬
‭ but overall this was a weak position for Brand.‬
‬‭ Herbin Legends began the year with a 139.68 point bonanza in Week 1, but scored only‬
‭ 95.6 PPG in the next 14 games.‬
‬‭ Herbin Legends hit a new low in Week 14, scoring an abysmal 48.46 points in Week 14,‬
‭ thanks to a couple of last-second DNPs. This 48.46 point effort was the worst‬
‭ performance in the PPR era (2021-2024), and the lowest output since 2020 (since 28.7‬
‭ points from Jasjaap’s Primo Team, Week 12).‬
‭
‭
‭
‭
‭
‭
‭
‭
‭
‭
‭
‭
‬‭ In the early years of DKEHeads, Herbin Legends was consistently one of the best teams‬
‭ in the league, scoring at least +5.0 PPG above league average each season from‬
‭2012-2015.‬
‭
‬‭ However, med school and residency have taken a toll. In the past few years, Herbin‬
‭ Legends has become one of the worst franchises in the league, finishing -8.8 PPG‬
‭ below average or worse in each of the last 3 seasons.‬
‭
‬‭ The 2024 version of Herbin Legends was the 8th worst team of all time.‬


‭ Gee Whiz Darnell: The Team that Deserved the Sacko, Part II‬
‭ Gee Whiz Darnell threw away their season in the first 5 minutes of the draft, wasting nearly‬
‭ $150 to acquire Christian McCaffrey and Tyreek Hill. Gee Whiz Darnell staggered to an 11‬‭ th‬
‭ place finish and scored only‬‭ 101.1 PPG (11‬‭ th‬
‭ of 12 teams,
-11.6 PPG vs. league baseline).‬
‭ Gee Whiz Darnell’s roster was okay at most positions, but horrendous at RB:‬
‬‭ QB: 16.0 PPG (8‬‭th‬ of 12 teams,
-1.0 PPG vs. league‬‭ average)‬‭ . Gee Whiz astutely‬
‭ picked up Baker Mayfield (19.5 PPG in ten starts) on waivers after drafting Trevor‬
‭ Lawrence and Aaron Rodgers. Besides Baker, Gee Whiz was too cute and made bad‬
‭ start decisions (Derek Carr, Daniel Jones, Tua) the other five weeks.‬
‬‭ RB (top 2): 17.8 PPG (12‬‭th‬ of 12 teams,
-10.3 PPG vs. league average).‬‭ Gee Whiz‬
‭ struggled mightily at RB with McCaffrey sidelined. Gee Whiz’s top producers were‬
‭ Tyrone Tracy (9.8 PPG in starts), Jerome Ford (9.9 PPG in five starts), and McCaffrey‬
‭ (8.1 PPG in five starts). Gross.‬
‬‭ WR (top 3): 34.5 PPG (7‬‭th‬ of 12 teams,
-1.3 PPG vs. league average)‬‭ . Tyreek Hill‬
‭ (11.5 PPG) was one of the biggest busts of the season. Courtland Sutton (14.1 PPG)‬
‭ surprisingly was Gee Whiz’s highest-scoring receiver. Jayden Reed (12.1 PPG in starts)‬
‭ and Zay Flowers (9.9 PPG in starts) were ok but inconsistent.‬
‬‭ TE: 12.3 PPG (1‬‭st‬ of 12 teams, +3.7 PPG vs. league average)‬‭ . Gee Whiz benefitted‬
‭ from both Trey McBride’s consistency (10.9 PPG) and a late season surge from Jonnu‬
‭ Smith (17.6 PPG (!) from Weeks 11-15).‬
‭ Gee Whiz Darnell was dreadful in the first half of the season, starting 1-6 and scoring only 92.6‬
‭ PPG in that stretch (-18.2 PPG below league average). It was the 8th‬‭ worst ever start to a‬
‭ season. Gee Whiz recovered in midseason (averaging 108.6 PPG the rest of the season and‬
‭ going 3-1 from Weeks 9-12), doing just enough to survive the Sacko.‬

‭ Brady come back u can blame it: From First to Worst‬
‭ After winning his second DKEHeads title in 2023, Will crashed down to earth and “earned” the‬
‭ Sacko in 2024. Brady come back u can blame it… did not light up the scoreboard (‬‭ 106.5 PPG,‬
‭ 10‬‭th‬ of 12 teams,
-6.3 PPG vs. league average‬‭ ) but was unfortunate to finish with a terrible‬
‭ 3-12 record. (The metrics suggest Brady come back u can blame it… should have finished‬
‭ around 6-9).‬
‭ Brady come back u can blame it… surprisingly‬‭ led the league in WR scoring‬‭ , but was weak at‬
‭ other positions:‬
QB: 13.7 PPG (11‬‭th‭ of 12 teams, -3.6 PPG vs. league average)‬‭ . Geno Smith (16.7‬
‭ PPG in 7 starts) was decent, but Will suffered from Caleb Williams’s poor rookie year‬
‭ (11.8 PPG in 7 starts).‬
‬‭ RB (top 2)‬‭:‬‭ 20.4 PPG (11‬‭th‬ of 12 teams, -7.7 PPG vs. league average)‬‭: Travis Etienne‬
‭ (7.7 PPG) was arguably the biggest bust of the season. Tony Pollard (11.2 PPG in 7‬
‭ starts) was a good late season pickup, Zach Charbonnet had several excellent games‬
‭ (14.5 PPG in 7 starts), and Austin Ekeler provided depth (9.1 PPG). But Etienne’s‬
‭ disappearing act was a crushing blow.‬
‬‭ WR (top 3): 42.2 PPG (1‬‭st‬ of 12 teams, +6.5 PPG vs. league average)‬‭ : it’s shocking‬
‭ that the Sacko recipient led the league in a position as important as WR. Will had‬
‭ awesome depth at WR, including Amon-Ra St. Brown (15.4 PPG), Drake London (12.3‬
‭ PPG), Jaxon Smith-Njigba (11.6 PPG), and Ladd McConkey (11.1 PPG).‬
‬‭ TE: 8.8 PPG (5‬‭th‬ of 12 teams, +0.1 PPG vs. league average).‬‭ Travis Kelce (8.8 PPG)‬
‭ was “washed up” for most of the season. With a star as big as Kelce at TE, finishing at‬
‭ league average was very disappointing. Week 1 waiver wire sensation Isaiah Likely‬
‭ contributed nothing.‬
‬‭ K:‬‭ 7.0 PPG (12‬‭th‬ of 12 teams, -2.0 PPG vs. league average):‬‭ Will’s team was last in‬
‭ the league in kicking points. Jason Myers and Jake Moody were both underwhelming.‬
‭ Brady come back u can blame it… started the year with a dreadful 67.42 point performance in‬
‭ Week 1. It was the worst Week 1 performance of any team in the PPR era (2021-2024) and the‬
‭ worst since 2019.‬ Will rebounded a bit, splitting his next four games to improve to 2-3. But a six-game losing‬ streak dropped the Brady bunch to last place at 2-9. A Week 12 win gave the squad some hope,‬ but Will lost his last 3 games (opponents scored +130 points in each game) en route to Sacko‬
‭ humiliation.‬
‭ Will’s team was very unlucky in the second half of the season, scoring 115.8 PPG from Weeks‬
‭ 10-15 (+1.7 PPG vs. league average) but going just 1-5 in that span.‬
‭ Brady come back u can blame it… was the‬‭ 3rd best‬‭ Sacko team of all time (see table below).‬
‭ Small consolation after a miserable campaign.‬
