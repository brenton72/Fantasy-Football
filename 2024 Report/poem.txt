DKEHeads rise, a league of tales untold,
Where victories are crafted, stories bold.
From dynasties to underdog fights,
Each season paints a brand-new light.

GOBias Industries, a fantasy dream,
Three-time champs, the ultimate team.
Schulwolf leads with wisdom and flair,
A juggernaut built with tactical care.

Gibbs and Cook ran like men inspired.
McLaurin and Smith brought steady play,
While Thielen shined down the stretch in a big way.

From Denver's defense to Aubrey's boot,
Each piece of the puzzle played its pursuit.
Thrice they've conquered, a legacy sealed,
With grit and numbers, their fate revealed.

Schmaap, the underdog turned fierce contender,
A season to cherish, a tale to remember.
With Jacobs and Montgomery pounding the ground,
And Purdy and Nix as values profound.

From Puka’s return to Bowers' rise,
Schmaap soared high, a team to idolize.
Though injuries struck, they refused to fall,
Fighting with heart till the very last call.

Mr. Fan began with strength and flair,
A powerhouse early, but injuries hit their air.
With Jackson leading, RB depth so deep,
Yet WR struggles left the path steep.

Pierogi Night surged with grit and might,
A slow start turned into a fierce fight.
Derrick Henry carried the charge,
Turning doubt into a playoff march.

Statistical kings with a winning dream.
Josh Allen led, Saquon shone bright,
Yet fate didn’t favor their might.

Pay Dirt piled up points with might,
With Burrow and Chase shining bright.
Aaron Jones and Swift led the way,
But playoffs slipped just one game away.

With Mixon’s runs and hopes that rose.
Yet struggles in QB left them adrift,
A playoff push they couldn’t lift.

With Achane’s bursts and WRs who rose.
Midseason struggles, but they persisted,
Late-season wins kept their hopes lifted.

Bijan the Second Date: Star Power, Shallow Depth
With Hurts’ steady play and Robinson’s heft.
Yet struggles at RB left the team sparse,
Depth was missing to push past the stars.

Herbin Legends faced an uphill climb,
Scoring just 98.6 per game, the league’s lowest rhyme.
QB struggles plagued the roster with no reprieve,
While RBs Walker and Irving brought brief relief.

Gee Whiz Darnell's draft fell apart with a costly spend,
Christian McCaffrey and Tyreek Hill, the money they’d rend.
QB play showed glimpses, but RBs sank the ship,
With Tracy and Ford offering a shaky grip.

After glory, Will faced a steep descent,
A Sacko fate that left him far from content.
With WRs leading the league, yet RBs in disarray,
The climb back up feels like a far-off day.

Through triumphs and trials, the journey unfolds,
Each season a story, where memories are told.
From legends to underdogs, the league will embrace,
A bond forged through numbers, in the fantasy space.
